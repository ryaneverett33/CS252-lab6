# Dino Dash Multiplayer 
This readme contains information related to how multiplayer/matchmaking is implemented and how to interact with it.
## Socket.io Signals
 ### Socket operations
 Connect and Disconnect are supported as default. Connect does not automatically start matchmaking, but disconnect ends all possible option for matchmaking
 ### Player operations
 #### Player.jump, duck, hit
 Registers a jump/duck/hit from a player, the other player will be updated of the operation. 

Returns: TBD
 #### Board.get
 Retrieves the next state of the board so that each player has  an identical copy of the board. Board.get should be called  until the game ends. This returns a buffer of enemies to be spawned by the client. It only needs to be called when the player is close to the end of the buffer.
 
Returns: TBD
#### Match.findGame, joinGame, leave, getPlayers
findGame

Starts the matchmaking process and finds another player to join the match. 

Returns: 
```json
{ "matchid" : "string(4 letters)" }
```
The matchid can allow anybody to join the game with the given code or just wait for an automatic match to happen.
